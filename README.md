   - Source code is available on GitHub, allowing developers to contribute and report issues.

6. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Includes a modular framework, where you can include only the necessary libraries and dependencies.
   - Reduces the application's footprint and improves performance.

### Getting Started with .NET Core

To get started with .NET Core, you’ll need to install the .NET SDK. Here’s how to create and run a simple .NET Core application:

#### 1. Install .NET SDK

Download and install the .NET SDK from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

#### 2. Create a New Project

Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new console application:

```bash
dotnet new console -o MyDotNetCoreApp
cd MyDotNetCoreApp
```

#### 3. Write Your Code

Open the `Program.cs` file in your favorite code editor and replace its contents with the following code:

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyDotNetCoreApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, .NET Core!");
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. Build and Run the Application

Use the following commands to build and run your application:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, .NET Core!
```

### Developing Web Applications with ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is a framework for building web applications and services using .NET Core. Here’s how to create a simple ASP.NET Core web application:

#### 1. Create a New Web Project

```bash
dotnet new webapp -o MyWebApp
cd MyWebApp
```

#### 2. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to see your web application in action.

### Resources for Learning .NET Core

- **Microsoft Docs**: Comprehensive documentation and tutorials for .NET Core.
- **Books**: "Pro ASP.NET Core 3" by Adam Freeman, "C# 8.0 and .NET Core 3.0" by Mark J. Price.
- **Online Courses**: Pluralsight, Udemy, and Coursera offer various courses on .NET Core.

### Conclusion

.NET Core provides a powerful, versatile, and high-performance platform for building a wide range of applications. Its cross-platform capabilities, modular architecture, and modern development practices make it an excellent choice for developers.
